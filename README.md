# Coursework for "Learn Stylized Game Art Creation : Blender and Painter"

This contains the work created when completing the course [Learn Stylized Game Art Creation : Blender and Painter](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-stylized-game-art-creation-blender-and-painter/). The course described itself with:

> Want to make beautiful game ready stylized props? Blender is slowly being adopted by big companies such as Ubisoft and EA as well as many up and coming indie studios as their main software of choice to make game art! While the software is impressive with many features and affordability, the documentation for a game art workflow in blender is still scarce, I hope to bring the necessary information and techniques you help you transition or start making game assets with blender
>
> Learn all the necessary tools and tips to create game ready assets while creating 2 stylized projects from scratch. The goal of this course is to bridge the gap to create game art with more affordable software but still keeping industry standard workflows. For the best experience, the entire project takes a hands on approach to learning and you build all the assets from scratch. The source files are also provided for reference and study.
